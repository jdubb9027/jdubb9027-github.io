                    <p class="projects-details">
                        This projects is still in the process of being worked on. I decided to do this project because I love playing chess but am not the biggest fan of playing online
                        or on a computer screen. So after doing a bit of research and planning I came up with the A.I. Chessboard. The chess A.I will most likely be powered by Stockfish 
                        an open-source chess engine and I believe there will be two boards doing the work one an Arduino Uno which does the heavy lifting as far as powering the stepper motors
                        with the help of a CNC shield and toggling power to the electromagnet when needed. The brains of the operation though which will be where stockfish is uploaded will be
                        a Raspberry Pi which will tell the arduino what to do and when to do it. The playing surface I am using a generic glass chessboard so that you can have a view of the 
                        inner-workings of the board. Each piece will have a small magnet at the base, this is so the piece can interact with hall-effect sensors that are attached to each 
                        square of the board and gives the brains the ability to know the position of each piece. There is also an electromagnet that is mounted on a gantry made up of 
                        two screw rods powered each by a stepper motor and a linear rail across them also powered by its own stepper with a pulley and belt system to move the electromagnet 
                        precisely to each square and activate the electromagnet to move a piece. I have designed many of the parts I needed on fusion 360 and using my 3D printer been
                        able to create custom parts for the project. A few examples would be the board pillars which are at each corner of the board and allows the board to sit snuggly 
                        in place and keeping a clean view of all the workings of the chessboard and clearance for the movement of the gantry. Also, I created custom levelers for the screw rods 
                        as well as the carriage for the electromagnet which again allows for just a snug fit with no adhesive or screws needed and a place for the wire to neatly escape 
                        the carrige and attach to the arduino.

                    <h3 class="project-title">Pi Garden</h3>
                    <p class="projects-details">
                        My Pi-Garden is an ongoing project that I am always updating and making more efficient or 
                        adding functionality. I have an indoor garden and it can take alot of work and attention
                        to get the plants to grow and prosper. With modern life it can be hard to find the time to make 
                        sure all the love and attention is given to all the plants. My first simple iteration was with 
                        an arduino it measured soil moisture, temperature and humidity, and watered the plant with small 
                        pump and 3D printed watering disk. I also designed and printed an enclosed water tank that had a 
                        motor on the top cylinder attached to it was a shaft and mixer that would mix any nutrients that 
                        was in the water before being pumped to the plant. Also, because the tank was enclosed and the 
                        pumps used needed water in them for them to work the tank was airtight enough when top cylinder was 
                        slide on top that as the water level dropped the cylinder would slide down to equalize air pressure.
                        This allowed for water to always remain in the pump after being turned off and infact helped push the 
                        water up to the pot which was about 1 1/2ft - 2ft above the pump and tank. The new iteration will have
                        the same functionality as the arduino based but with the Rpi will have wifi and BLT capability as well
                        as being able to measure and add a 3 part nutrient system when needed instead of having it premixed and 
                        possibly build up bacteria that could harm the plants instead of helping also monitor water Ph. This 
                        information will all be available online because of the wifi on the Rpi. With the added power I will also 
                        connect intake and outtake fans so the system can control the temperature and humidity within the grow space
                        by controlling the fans individual speeds.
