            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p id="profile-para">I am currently a student at Delaware County Community College and graduate in May 2022
                with my Associates in Engineering. Aquiring my degree in engineering and supporting my son 
                are my main focus in life. My dream career would be working in the A.I./Machine Learning field creating "things"
                that will improve on the quality of life of society as a whole, not just do tasks that make our everyday lives easier. 
                I have interests in anything RC mostly planes and submarines as this allows me to create and learn on a large array of subjects
                from A.I. with the auto-pilot to aesthetics and the communication of the electronics. I have always loved to tinker and take
                things apart to figure out how things work and how they are able to do what they do, and how they can be "better" or more efficient. 
                I am always trying to learn more and gain more knowledge on as much as I can from coding, basic circuit analysis, Machine Learning and A.I.,
                computer security, and so much more. I also am an artist and love to draw mostly with graphite or charcoal. I also am learning airbrushing
                at the moment mostly doing body painting but would like to expand on that and would like to get into painting with acrylics. I have recently
                gotten into gardening mostly vegetables and as with everything else cannot help myself but to add electronics to my garden.
                I am researching starting an aquaponics set up in my home...atleast to start. Plus I love coffee and it is even better in the outdoors.</p>

                    <h3 class="project-title">A.I. Controlled Chessboard</h3>
                    <p class="projects-details">
                        This projects is still in the process of being worked on. I decided to do this project because I
                        love playing chess but am not the biggest fan of playing online <img class="chess-project" src="images/CNC-shield.JPG">
                        or on a computer screen. So after doing a bit of research and planning I came up with the A.I.
                        Chessboard. The chess A.I will most likely be powered by Stockfish which is 
                        an open-source chess engine. At the moment I believe there will be two boards doing the work, 
                        I am using an Uno with the help of this CNC shield V3 which is pictured on the left.
                        These will do the heavy lifting as far as powering the stepper motors, limit switches
                        and toggling the power to the electromagnet when needed.
                        I am planning the brains of the operation,
                        which will be where stockfish is uploaded, to be a Raspberry Pi 4 which will tell the arduino
                        what to do and when to do it. For the playing surface I am using a generic glass chessboard so that
                        the player can have a view of the inner-workings of the board and see all the movement. This will also
                        allow LEDs to be added 
                        underneath the glass squares and play with a glowing board if desired, I have yet to test this idea though.
                        Each chess piece will have a small magnet at the base to allow for the hall effect sensors to sense the pieces
                        and their positions as the move around the board. This is essentially the eyes of the A.I. if the Rpi is the brain
                        <img class="chess-project" id="top-fullBoard" src="images/top view with board.JPG">
                        and gives the Rpi the ability to "see" each piece. This will be possible because each square of the board will have
                        its own hall-effect sensor all soldered together like a grid so that I can pinpoint each piece similiar to battleship. 
                        The electromagnet mentioned above is mounted on a 3D printed gantry that itself is mounted on a linear rail. On each side
                        there are two screw rods powered each by a stepper motor. The gantry slides on the linear rail by its
                        own stepper motor with a pulley and belt system to move the electromagnet
                        precisely to each square. When the magnet is at its set position it will activate and move the pieces. 
                        I have plans already to make this a better design as after starting building I found out about a belt and pulley setup that 
                        <img class="chess-project" id="magnet" src="images/Belt-arm&magnet.jpg">
                        will allow me to do the same kind of movements quicker and with one less stepper motor. I have designed many of
                        the parts I needed on fusion 360 and using my 3D printer been
                        able to create custom parts for the project. A few examples would be the board pillars which are
                        at each corner of the board and allows the board to sit snuggly 
                        in place and keeping a clean view of all the workings of the chessboard and clearance for the
                        movement of the gantry. Also, I created custom levelers for the screw rods
                        as well as the carriage for the electromagnet which again allows for just a snug fit with no
                        adhesive or screws needed and a place for the wire to neatly escape
                        the carrige and attach to the arduino shield. As I think the pictures show this project is a work in progress but
                        is the main project I work on. I also would just like to say that though I may have thought about this independently there are
                        chess boards similiar to this concept available commercially.

                    <h3 class="project-title">Pi Garden</h3>
                    <p class="projects-details">
                        My Pi-Garden is an ongoing project that I am always updating and making more efficient or
                        adding functionality to. I have an indoor garden and it can take alot of work and attention
                        to get the plants to grow and prosper. With modern life it can be hard to find the time to make
                        sure all the love and attention is given to all the plants. My first simple iteration was with
                        an arduino it measured soil moisture, temperature and humidity, and watered the plants with a small
                        water pump some tubing and 3D printed watering disks that would spike into the ground and encircle the
                        stem of the plants.<img class="pi-garden" id="mixer" src="images/H2O tank nute mixer.JPG"> I had realized I had an 
                        issue though during the setup and initial run of the water pump because the plants were couple feet above the pump 
                        and that I wanted the water tank to be closed off from outside air and contaminants as the water was pumped up and out 
                        a vacumn would be created in the tank and stop the pump from working plus putting significant stress on the motor and 
                        componets of the pump because of back pressure and it fighting the vacumn. My solution to this was to create a dynamic 
                        tank that would change its pressure as the water volume changed. I accomplished this by 3D printing two halves of a cylinder the 
                        bottom would be the water tank but the top half of the cylinder is slightly larger to create an air tight seal when top half is placed 
                        on bottom and acts as the dynamic part of the system.<img class="pi-garden" id="stacked" src="images/Stacked water tank.JPG"> 
                        The way it works is simple when the tank is filled with water it sits like in the picture of the stacked halves but 
                        when the water starts to be pumped out of tank and the vacumn is created instead of fighting the pump 
                        it pulls the top cylinder down creating a stable pressure again this also acts as a crude way of knowing when to refill the water.
                        As can be seen in the bottom picture and from the other pictures this is a motor installed at the top of the tank that goes through
                        the center of the top half and is attached to a shaft with a mixer I designed that is programmed to turn on shortly before the pump
                        so it can mix up any nutrients/fetilizer that has settled at the bottom of the tank. I used an old cheap drone motor that was geared 
                        to power the mixer as it takes a significant amount of force to spin the shaft against the drag of the water as by design its created
                        to not be streamline to completely mix solution. This ability to always keep constant pressure allowed for water to always remain in 
                        the pump after being turned off which infact helped push the water up to the garden which was about 1.5ft - 2ft above the pump and tank. 
                        The new iteration will have the same functionality as the arduino based but the Rpi-Garden will give the benefits of wifi and BLE capability 
                        allowing access to data and control of system anywhere with the setup of a web server controller. In the first iteration the nutrients was added 
                        and measured manually which sat in tank <img class="pi-garden" id="motor" src="images/H2O tank motor.JPG">
                        until it was needed which could be days and sometimes we do not want the nutrients but pH neutral water which would mean wasting the nutrient 
                        solution that had been mixed. With the Pi-Garden plan to add a 3 part nutrient system using peristaltic pumps to added exact quantites when needed 
                        instead of having it premixed and possibly build up bacteria that could harm the plants instead of helping with this I also plan a monitoring
                        system for the water pH. The Rpi gives an added ability of a "brain" so I can code a program to monitor temp. and humididty as well as
                        control intake and outtake fans connected to the system to have complete control of enviorment inside the grow space by simply
                        controlling the fans individual speeds to bring more or less fresh air into the space. The Garduino based system was all done on a breadboard as I
                        said with a Nano as a proof of concept the 2nd iteration I plan to create a circuit board to assist with running everything along with the Pi. 
                        As I start building the 2nd iteration with the Rpi and put it into use I will post pictures of the build and componets I use.
