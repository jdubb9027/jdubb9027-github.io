            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p id="profile-para">I am currently a student at Delaware County Community College and graduate in May 2022
                with my Associates in Engineering.
                I love coffee and it is even better in the outdoors watching the sunrise over a misty morning. Getting
                my degree in engineering and working
                in computer or A.I./Machine Learning fields are my main focus in life. I have interests in RC planes,
                cars, and boats I love to tinker and take
                things apart and figure out how things work or do what I can to make them "better" or more efficient. I
                am always trying to get more information
                and knowledge on as much as I can from coding, basic circuit analysis, Machine Learning and A.I.,
                computer security, as well as have studied and
                played as amatuer poker player for two years. I also am an artist and love to draw mostly with graphite
                or charcoal but would like to get into
                painting with acrylics. I am also an amatuer gardener mostly vegetables and as with everything else
                cannot help myself but to add electronics
                to my garden so I am researching starting a aquaponics set up in my home to start.</p>

                    <h3 class="project-title">A.I. Controlled Chessboard</h3>
                    <p class="projects-details">
                        This projects is still in the process of being worked on. I decided to do this project because I
                        love playing chess but am not the biggest fan of playing online <img class="chess-project" src="images/CNC-shield.JPG">
                        or on a computer screen. So after doing a bit of research and planning I came up with the A.I.
                        Chessboard. The chess A.I will most likely be powered by Stockfish which is 
                        an open-source chess engine. At the moment I believe there will be two boards doing the work, 
                        I am using an Uno with the help of this CNC shield V3 which is pictured on the left.
                        These will do the heavy lifting as far as powering the stepper motors, limit switches
                        and toggling the power to the electromagnet when needed.
                        I am planning the brains of the operation,
                        which will be where stockfish is uploaded, to be a Raspberry Pi 4 which will tell the arduino
                        what to do and when to do it. For the playing surface I am using a generic glass chessboard so that
                        the player can have a view of the inner-workings of the board and see all the movement. This will also
                        allow LEDs to be added 
                        underneath the glass squares and play with a glowing board if desired, I have yet to test this idea though.
                        Each chess piece will have a small magnet at the base to allow for the hall effect sensors to sense the pieces
                        and their positions as the move around the board. This is essentially the eyes of the A.I. if the Rpi is the brain
                        <img class="chess-project" id="top-fullBoard" src="images/top view with board.JPG">
                        and gives the Rpi the ability to "see" each piece. This will be possible because each square of the board will have
                        its own hall-effect sensor all soldered together like a grid so that I can pinpoint each piece similiar to battleship. 
                        The electromagnet mentioned above is mounted on a 3D printed gantry that itself is mounted on a linear rail. On each side
                        there are two screw rods powered each by a stepper motor. The gantry slides on the linear rail by its
                        own stepper motor with a pulley and belt system to move the electromagnet
                        precisely to each square. When the magnet is at its set position it will activate and move the pieces. 
                        I have plans already to make this a better design as after starting building I found out about a belt and pulley setup that 
                        <img class="chess-project" id="magnet" src="images/Belt-arm&magnet.jpg">
                        will allow me to do the same kind of movements quicker and with one less stepper motor. I have designed many of
                        the parts I needed on fusion 360 and using my 3D printer been
                        able to create custom parts for the project. A few examples would be the board pillars which are
                        at each corner of the board and allows the board to sit snuggly 
                        in place and keeping a clean view of all the workings of the chessboard and clearance for the
                        movement of the gantry. Also, I created custom levelers for the screw rods
                        as well as the carriage for the electromagnet which again allows for just a snug fit with no
                        adhesive or screws needed and a place for the wire to neatly escape
                        the carrige and attach to the arduino shield. As I think the pictures show this project is a work in progress but
                        is the main project I work on. I also would just like to say that though I may have thought about this independently there are
                        chess boards similiar to this concept available commercially.

                    <h3 class="project-title">Pi Garden</h3>
                    <p class="projects-details">
                        My Pi-Garden is an ongoing project that I am always updating and making more efficient or
                        adding functionality. I have an indoor garden and it can take alot of work and attention
                        to get the plants to grow and prosper. With modern life it can be hard to find the time to make
                        sure all the love and attention is given to all the plants. My first simple iteration was with
                        an arduino it measured soil moisture, temperature and humidity, and watered the plant with small
                        pump and 3D printed watering disk. I also designed and printed an enclosed water tank that had a
                        motor on the top cylinder attached to it was a shaft and mixer that would mix any nutrients that
                        was in the water before being pumped to the plant. Also, because the tank was enclosed and the
                        pumps used needed water in them for them to work the tank was airtight enough when top cylinder
                        was
                        slide on top that as the water level dropped the cylinder would slide down to equalize air
                        pressure.
                        This allowed for water to always remain in the pump after being turned off and infact helped
                        push the
                        water up to the pot which was about 1 1/2ft - 2ft above the pump and tank. The new iteration
                        will have
                        the same functionality as the arduino based but with the Rpi will have wifi and BLT capability
                        as well
                        as being able to measure and add a 3 part nutrient system when needed instead of having it
                        premixed and
                        possibly build up bacteria that could harm the plants instead of helping also monitor water Ph.
                        This
                        information will all be available online because of the wifi on the Rpi. With the added power I
                        will also
                        connect intake and outtake fans so the system can control the temperature and humidity within
                        the grow space
                        by controlling the fans individual speeds.
